1,Smith & Jones,The worst thing for me since mandatory Video with Prime.,1.0,"I dropped Amazon Prime due to the massive hike in price when the option NOT to simply have a dedicated delivery service ALONE, without video/film etc I would not watch was introduced as a 'bundle'.The stupidity of the notion I would pay the same price for audio books alone is even more frustrating.Yes, I read, and I like books, especially in the physical format.What I do not like is Amazon policy of bundling products like delivery and video, so for me at least, clearly amongst many others, this proposal is the most absurd yet.My Amazon purchases are getting lower and lower as I buy more and more elsewhere for faster delivery; all as a direct result of ongoing ideas such as this.",9 May 2017
2,Zahid,Love concept! But not currently value for money.,2.0,"Don't get me wrong, I am really enjoying listening to an audiobook for a change. Its nice to relax with in bed and just listen. However, the price of this is a big issue. £7.99 per month for one audiobook is crazily steep. This price is not that much off buying the audiobook outright each month and therefore just ties you in. My second issue that I am little disappointed is that as an Prime customer there is no integration, or discount of any short, unlike the US version who have audible fully included within its package. I believe that this should be put in place across all its countries due to paying the same ( if not more) for this service. However, I am obviously aware that audiobooks are not cheap but with amazon being such a big company, and netfix or its own amazon prime instant video branch offering a better deal for a lower price they need to work with the customer to make this a success!",17 January 2016
3,Shazebee,Imagine if Netflix used this concept. £8 for 1 free film a mth? NOPE!,1.0,Currently trialing it but wont be continuing! As if its £7.99 for 1 book! Imag8ne if this was how netflix or prime video operated? 1 movie a mth and pay average of £10 to watch any of the others.....erm nope!Bit greedy! Shame on you amazon!Pretty sure audio book doesnt cost more than a film to make!It should be free with my prime!,7 March 2017
4,Kieren Geaney,Good but a bit too expensive for whats on offer.,2.0,"I finished a book in 2 weeks and am not allowed another until the next month.  For the money I would expect unlimited listening. The app on android works well and keeps position allowing you to stream or download.  It is quite a battery hog though for an audio player.  I like the audible experience and listing to my first book was enjoyable but I wont keep the subscription.  If they could offer unlimited for the same money I would be in.  For now I wont continue the subscription, I will try my local library of kindle unlimited as others have mentioned.  At the moment, Audible misses the mark.  I will try again maybe next year in case they decide to listen to the feedback.  If the value proposition or monthly limit it not a problem for you, then this is a good app / product.",19 May 2017
5,Miss Scarlett,To counterbalance the one star reviews...,4.0,"Presumably many of these reviewers clicked on the '0.00 with Audible' option when you go to purchase a book/audiobook as it seems quite a few are giving it one star due to their own negligence.Those who say it's too expensive have no idea how much audiobooks actually cost- they can easily cost £30- because they're more expensive to produce than books. Also, you can use your credit for any audiobook, whatever the price.Audible will also heavily discount the cost of other audiobooks for you (this is where they make their money, in reducing the cost of some audiobooks below the 7.99 mark so you feel you don't want to waste your credit on them), plus they have some exclusive free podcasts.If you don't listen to audiobooks that often, you may prefer to use your local library's app or borrow a CD from your local library.As with all memberships, the best thing to do is to first make a note of how many audiobooks you actually want to purchase and how many of them are more expensive than 7.99. At the very least, a free trial is worth it as you can keep the free book.",15 April 2020

7,D. C.,stupid pricce,2.0,the amount they want does not equal good value at all.  its the same amount of money as prime membership.  and you get free delivery of items and as much tv and movies as you want.there has to be other audio book services that offer a great deal more for less money than 7.99  or 96 pound a year.there are a few free ones  if your going to pay for a service you expect to get choice and and value.why dont they just include in prime membership for a single book they must think people are slow listeners.when you go to a library you can take out a number of books  why dont they do you can load 1 audio book at a time when finished you can get another.I dont see how they have any members at this price and service,11 June 2017
8,Wibble,Terrible customer service,2.0,"After year of happy use of Audible, my Audible library is over 220 books, I've cancelled my membership in protest at the shoddy customer service I've had in my last three encounters.I've never had to deal with trained customer service who refuse to answer my question, who rephrase my question so it no longer means the same thing and then answer that instead. They are worse than politicians or Supreme Court nominees.Three times I've tried to enquire as to why some of my books are 128kbps and sound great, and other are 64kbps and sound okay at best, and like garbage at worst. All of my downloads are supposed to be the highest quality, but they are clearly not all the same. Most annoying of all, the Audible full-cast Alien dramas sound wildly inconsistent with two being high quality, and two being hot garbage. All I'm asking is when will the crap ones be upgraded, and Audible won't even acknowledge that there's any difference between the 128kbps and the 64kbps files. It's like banging you head against a wall. So in future, I will buy from iTunes :(",17 September 2019

I love audiobooks, but this 'deal' is very unappealing to me. Amazon need to rethink their strategy on this one, if they want to attract more customers.",20 December 2015
10,Amazon Customer,"Too expensive, use your library",1.0,"This is far too expensive at £7.99 a month for one audio book.

23,Stuart79,"Good value, but would prefer a streaming service",4.0,"I bought an annual membership up front at £69.99 for 12 credits - pretty good value, as that works out at just £5.80 a book.  Especially if you go for the longer books costing over £25 or so.Having said that, though, Audible's advertised 'regular price' should be treated with a pinch of salt.  ""America - Empire of Liberty"", for example, is shown as £27.99.  Now I would never pay that in a month of Sundays - the same audiobook can be bought elsewhere (without a lot of searching, either) for just £9.99.  So I would happily use one credit at £5.80 to purchase, download and own it.The overall range of books is very impressive - I especially like documentaries and radio drama, and even there, there are literally hundreds to choose from.Overall, though - I'd have preferred an all-you-can-eat streaming service, something like that offered by Netflix or Spotify.

Starting the subscription when the six year says no to the subscription (Alexa had the conversation history)C. Amazon customer services having removed the email option spend 2 and a half hours refusing to raise a complaint andD. using tricks such as transferring without warning, colleagues pretending to be managers etc; andE.

Have contacted Amazon support who referred me to Amazon Audible who told me I had to sign up to be able to listen to it. The Amazon support team on the contrary said I should be able to listen without joining Amazon Audible. NONE of them have successfully told me how I listen to this book. I did try A Audible but the selection and the prices are totally ridiculous and not worth the subscription money.

Have to say that Audible customer service has becaome pretty useless since they got sawllowed up by the monster that is Amazon. Also in the UK we seem to miss out on a lot of titles available on Audible in other countries which is very dissapointing.

I prefer to listen to books rather than read them and I love how quick, easy and convenient is to do that on audible, at the touch of a button! I do agree though that the majority of books are way too expensive but bear in mind you get 1 free credit a month, which you can use to purchase any book, no matter the price. You can also swap it in exchange for another anytime, whatever the reason. Sometimes the book turns out to not be what I thought it was, or I can't finish it because that particular narrator's voice grates on me. All in all, I think the price of an audible membership is well worth it, (you also get a 30 day free trial) and would highly recommend. Some older books that I hoped to find are not on there though - please keep adding more and offer a wider selection!",4 March 2018

Jess and Gaurav in particular were really helpful to me. You can even return a title you don't finish if you don't like it, which sometimes comes in handy as a book can't always be judged by its cover.

Their background program that makes relevant recommendations to me - They advertise to me books that I would never have heard of that I thoroughly enjoy.4. Their selection of narrator is generally ideally matched to the subject3. The convenience of 1-Click ordering (but if they were to make one tiny overall improvement, it would be to allow the facility for a user to seamlessly join a USA account and UK account without having to sign in and out)2. The amazing selection of such a huge variety of books on such a wide range of topics1. Most of all, it its the overall package, the overall experience, the overall convenience.

My main problem is limiting my self to one book a month as the full price books are very expensive, I spend over 30 hours a month commuting by car and have to ration the play back to spread it through the month, as I am finding it such a pleasure and a pleasant diversion from Radio spoken word.",15 May 2016

53,Ruth,An absolute waste of money and time.,1.0,"Far too expensive for one book a month, thought I'd give it a try as it would be nice to carry on reading when I'm doing housework etc but was shocked to find that I can only listen to the book, if I want to read it myself at any point then I have to pay for the book separately as well! I read books because I love to read, if I can't read it myself when I want to then I'm not interested... I still have the original book I got for free in the first free trial and I haven't listed to it because if at any point I want to sit and read it myself I've got to shell out for the actual kindle version of the book too, an absolute rip off! The narrators read the book far too slowly for my liking too so it's a definite no from me!",27 August 2017

Soon realised I had been auto subcribed to Audible and an account created.  Nothing during the purchase process alerted me this would happen.  No warnings. requests for permission etc.  Audible will not allow me to close down or delete this account without submission of my credit card details.  I now understand that Audible automatically copies ALL cards and payment details from my Amazon Account.  Shocked to say the least.,28 March 2018

57,Amazon Customer,Worst idea ever!,1.0,The worst deal and not very customer service orientated. Who'd benefit more from this (unrealistic) concept?  Certainly not the customer! Buying multiple audio books (at approx. £15 each) per month surely would benefit Amazon financially more than it does the customer so why not go with that idea instead?This practice feels a bit unethical and Amazon is better listening to its customers before continuing such practice.,22 January 2017

Audible has no problems taking your card details from a mobile though! This should be sorted immediately by Amazon. And staff in anonymous “SE Asian” call centre told me there was no free membership when subscribed to Amazon Prime! I said I’ve got multiple entries up on Google in front of me saying it is and has been for some time. Requested a manager and after a struggle and a long wait got man purporting to be a manager who did not want to do anything but see me subscribed to Audible forever. After 35 mins of grief I terminated the call and stopped the sub on my desktop. Then rang Amazon who immediately refunded the month’s sub taken. Amazon would have stopped the sub too if I hadn’t already managed to do it. These underhand tactics are not what I’d associate with Amazon. Either the Audible call centre are lying about the Prime free access or they don’t know what they’re doing. This sucks, big time.

68,Amazon Customer,Too expensive,1.0,Way too expensive and misleading to offer a free book when actually you have to sign up and then remember to cancel after 30 days if you don't want to pay the monthly amount. £7.99 is a lot for one book per month.,28 May 2017
69,Shani,Huge range of books read by really good professional readers,4.0,"I think a lot of people who have written critical reviews of Audible aren't really audio book listeners. Audio books don't replace print, they're a different sort of experience. Audible has a huge range of books by really good readers, far more than your local library. Audio books are very expensive to produce and to buy - I've read reviews here saying they should be free, but what are the actors who read them supposed to live on? £7.99 for a long novel is a bargain. Having said that, I find the Audible format very restricting. I would like to listen on my mp3 player, also, putting them on CD so I can play them in the car is a long and tedious process.",12 March 2019

Now I come to try one I find they in fact are not free ! The wording is simply a ruse to suck people into an audio book subscription. Why is Amazon resorting to underhand tactics to try and get more business ? It seems Amazon gain the trust of customers with good quality offerings that are properly explained and then pop in the occasional lemon leaving a good proportion of the won over customers thinking twice about Amazon ethics. From now on I've got the extra task of reading carefully between the lines of Amazon advertising to winkle out any underhanded behaviour. They should at least have included some audio books within the Prime subscription.,23 August 2018

You must be signed into the right marketplace to get mobile content, the default was different to my purchasing region for some reason and the setting to change marketplace is well enough hidden to need to google it.  Lastly, I couldn't use my gift credit to buy audio books for kindle but that's not clear until you get some failed transactions.

My suggestion is that the subscription includes a number of books, perhaps on a leased basis, much like a video. Who really wants to ""own"" an audio book?

194,Sharky,"The biggest books retailer on the planet is unable to provide a value for money service? Come on Amazon, get real!",1.0,"For the last few weeks, the home screen of my Amazon account has been trying to seduce me with a fabulous free trial of Audiobooks. As a Prime customer, the offer is for three months’ free membership. I’m aware of the misery that it has caused some customers with confusing or misleading offers so I cautiously accepted the trial.Happily, everything went well. I did indeed get a full three months’ membership for free and very quickly I was being invited to download an App for my Android phone and spend the current month’s single credit on an audible book off my choice. As a fan of the original Star Trek series I opted for ‘Shatnerverse’ – a whopping four-hour long odyssey in the inner musings of the William Shatner! Great fun.As someone who has to endure regular, long car journeys as part of my job this is going to provide some much-needed distraction from the daily commute. So, I really like the concept of audible books and I think it's something I'm going to really enjoy.But, (there’s always a but), the current pricing structure is bonkers. One credit, or in other words, one book of your choice per month for £7.95 is insane. I don’t know what Amazon were thinking. The biggest retailer of books on the planet should be able to secure a much better deal for their customers than this offering.My first book lasts four hours, this is easily going to be listened to in about a week. What am I to do for the reminder of the month until I’m once again prompted (allowed) to select my next title? Whistle Dixie?Verdict: The biggest books retailer on the planet is unable to provide a value for money service? Come on Amazon, get real! On the current pricing strategy, my advice to new customers is to sign up, grab your three free audio books (one per month) and then click the Cancel Membership button. This is offer is just dumb.",27 October 2016

201,Cal,"Great concept, bad execution",1.0,"I love audiobooks, there's really no better way to drift off to sleep at night. However, Audible is not for me. There are a few reasons, and they're all to do with the platform, not the content.First off, Audible locks all their books with some of the worst Digital Restrictions Management I have ever seen. Not only do you have to activate each and every device you want to listen to your books on (which also means that devices like simple MP3 players will not play Audible books), but you also have to activate the computer you want to download them to your devices with. And activation does not appear to be permanent: I've had to re-activate my computer several times. Worst of all, there appears to be a limit to the number of devices you can activate, which I'm either near or at, so the next time this happens, I'll lose the books I paid for!Secondly, Audible has some very confusing options. When downloading a book, you have to choose between four versions: ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", and ""Enhanced"". I'm all in favour of giving the user options, but there doesn't actually appear to be an explanation of what this means anywhere on the site!And finally, the pricing model is badly broken, and the subscription choices are... weird, to say the least. One or two books per month, sure, I can understand that. You can also choose to buy 12 or 24 books all at once. That makes sense, just pay for a year up front. But if you want to buy an individual book, that can cost upwards of half the price of a subscription all in one go!All in all, Audible is not the way to experience audiobooks at their best. I'd recommend you visit your local library and check out what they have to offer: it's not instant, but neither is Audible, and the hire charge for an audiobook from your library is much cheaper than Audible.",20 April 2017

But when asked to login .. to my disappointment it was a free trial for a subscription service not a one free audiobook to download. This sux, and was very misleading and deceitful. I have been buying stuff  with amazon for a long time, and has a good reputation with the relationship between me and them.

I am only able to get one book for £7.99 per month and with the majority of books I would pick to read in the £15-£20 range even for short texts these books are extremely expensive.  I also have a blind family member who would LOVE this service however as a student it is out of her price range to afford.  Many devices including I-Phones, Kindle's and PCs offer free 'reading' applications which are improving daily, having books read into Audible may just become redundant before it is even financially attractive for a UK user to invest in, Amazon please play the game fairly and making Audible at least as cheap to use for UK customers as for US customers.",8 March 2017

So I tried to unsubscribe (I was irritated with the messing at this stage) but was told there was an error and I would have to ring the UK. Does this mean I am or am not a member,  and I have or have not signed up for a subscription.The current situation is that I have cancelled my credit card details with  Amazon and in spite of hundreds of purchases over the years I will not be re-joining until I am told clearly that I do not have a subscription with Audible.

287,Villa Girl,Why all the moaning? Audible is great!,5.0,I'm really shocked about the negative reviews on here for audible. I don't think people are very good at playing the game here. £7.99 per month gets you a free book. So far I have gone for absolute monsters that are 30+ hours long. These books cost a fortune full price (although I doubt many people pay £30 odd quid for them in reality) so I am getting a real bargain. I am at the point where it's taking me so long to listen to the books that I have a bit of a backlog. So I went to the audible site and looked at the 'cancel your membership' options. Here you can put your account on hold for 3 months - they don't charge you for those 3 months but you can use your credits and you can also buy audiobooks as normal. I think this is great. In 3 months I'll probably have caught up. I had my questions answered by 'Lice Chat' which is a fantastic customer service tool. I'm very surprised at all the moaning and groaning from people. I think Audible is fantastic!,16 June 2016

331,Zimsunflower237,Awesome audio to suit all ages,5.0,"Audible opened up the world of books to my reluctant reader. She still prefers audiobooks but will often get the corresponding book out and read it for herself after stress listened to a story.I've also found that by listening to the book before we watch the related movie (a standing rule in our home), that both my children have a clearer understanding of what is going on leaving them (and me) free to enjoy the movie without worrying about the outcome in the scary bits and they don't ask a million questions questions in the complicated bits either.I think the price is fair, in our case all of the books we've choosen are priced above the monthly fee, and because we only get 1 a month the children are learning to negotiate to make sure they are both happy with their choice each month, and we count down the days till we can choose a new book.Our favourites to date are  Harry Potter, Wonder, Truckers, Diggers & Wings, The Secret of Moon Acre, The Hobbit, Stig of the Dump and The Book Thief to name but a few.",21 May 2017

346,Cindy,Using accessibility software is Way Cheaper,1.0,Too expensive as everyone else has already commented.  I'm also visually impaired so would have loved this were it cheaper or as someone suggested included in prime as it is in the US. But my other contribution is that most devices have accessibility software which is free. Its best on apple devices but others do have them too. So why would people pay more for this service?  Plus you can't choose the voices or reading speed like you can with accessibility software.,15 August 2016

However I've just got back into it on without a doubt 799 is nothing compare it to what you could pay for some of really the good books out there.I'm not really a reader of books myself.  But I love the audio side and I've just started getting back into it but there's another book my sisters told me about that would cost me nearly £20 but because I'm part of the 799 a month membership, when I get it it's going to save me a lot of money. JK Rowling is bought out some fantastic books which she is going under a pseudonym, my sister was read all three and said they are amazing so again would cost me a fortune if I wasn't part of the Amazon audio.",5 March 2017

Very disappointed with a very shoddy service. I can't give it no stars, but I'd suggest people just don't bother.

I couldn't believe the prices when I'd finished my first included book and wanted to move onto another before my next token became available.. And so will be cancelling my subscription.

378,Constant Reader,Expensive but worth every penny...,5.0,"Expensive but worth every penny if you love books but don't have the time to read. I enjoy listening to my 'book de jour' for 3-4 hours per day as I walk. I choose books I otherwise wouldn't tackle--either because of length or whatever reason. Sapiens by Yuval Harari is one such book. I was given the physical book as a present and I leafed through it, thinking that it will be similar to many other books of its kind. As I travel a lot, I didn't take the physical book but I did download it. It was amazing--as was the sequel, Homo Deus. I would say this about other longish books (Name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco or even the recent complete set of Sherlock Holmes read by Stephen Fry or the Stephen King books). The audible product has been consistent and allows me to preview things before I buy. I have tried a lot of authors I wouldn't have otherwise tried. For me, quality reading and books are priceless. The only complaint would be that I can't share my audio books with my friends or family.",23 May 2017

My wife and I both use Sony Walkman MP3 players and this almost completely negates the point.It is possible to burn the tracks to CD and then rip them back as audio MP3s, but that is just ridiculous - and there appear to be ways to rip the tracks to MP3 using iPlayer - but I wouldn't wish that on my worse enemy.So I'm listening to Audible on my laptop, which is just possible to do while travelling, but really not convenient.",31 March 2016

Audible even gives me a Christmas present every year of a free title.  I can legally listen to the books again and again at any time of day, trips to my nearest large library are costly as they involve a 30 minute drive one way plus parking fees and my preferred audio book may not be available, choice is a bit limited and they are not always in the best condition.I do feel audible could look at the quality of the product as often the narration is interrupted by coughing, repetition and incorrect words being used.My suggestion is keep your credits for the expensive titles and buy the cheap ones.",24 May 2017

I occasionally buy audiobooks (Naxos Audiobooks) which I can use on any device and not trapped into the ""audible"" software. You have to use the audible software player on devices' (when I mistakenly tried a free trial with audible years ago) which means they kind of retain control of your purchase, if its still the same. So for the money and the selection there are many other legal sources and as large a range of titles. Plus sites with professionally produced audiobooks, at reasonable cost, that can be downloaded in mp4 or mp3 format that then become your property. NAXOS Audiobooks & Blackstone audio I think it is for example and others. If you must have a book a month, if you find you need a fresh one, buy it from a place you can own it, borrow audiobook CDs from one of many of your areas libraries, download volunteer produced audiobooks from librivox (which produce free,copyright free,) and so on.

452,Amazon Customer,Too much for too few.,1.0,"I think the pricing strategy needs to be re-thought. If the subscription was for unlimited access (as per music streaming sites) then it may be of interest. I often have various books on the go (fiction, factual and informational) at the same time so one title per month doesn't really cut it for the price (I know you can check in/out titles at any time but it's a ball-ache).Also as an existing Prime customer, I don't think paying the same amount as per Prime for audio books alone p.a. offers Prime members good value for money.Either make the selection/download unlimited  per month, or - preferably - just make it £1.99. At £8 quid a month it's too much.So Amazon you can have a lot of folk paying £1.99 a month or 1/2doz paying £8 quid a month? Your choice but it doesn't take an economist to work out which one would prove most profitable in the long run.",16 June 2017

I have signed up anyway, losing my 30 days free.

VINE VOICE",Superb way to read a book,5.0,"I had always been a traditionalist when it came to reading a book; then Audible came along. The genre is a revelation and was surprisingly a relaxing, thought-provoking and convenient way of tackling a book. The different types of subject matter is more than enough to suit all tastes; and the range of books within in each topic section is constantly increasing. Personally, my own library soon grew to quite an extensive size encompassing a range of book types that ranged from history to comedy to fiction; and continues to expand as the quantity of new books become available. I was even introduced to new subject topics that I would never of considered had I not used Audible.",23 May 2017

It's a bad deal, just read the feed-backs. People pay a good price for Echo and then your sting them. Why not let people join and then buy each book as in Kindle.

Of course I accept that people are free to have a differing opinion, I am just amazed by them, and saddened that so many have not experienced the enjoyment i have from this service.I have been a member for about 7 or 8 months and love it. My payments gets taken each month, and the credit appears in my audible account. I then look at all the books and pick one. I think the cheapest book i have picked so far would have cost me almost double to buy as a download, and the most expensive was almost £50 to buy, but mine for a £7.99 - Marvellous.Yes - if you are only ever going to buy £4 or £5.00 audio books - this is not the app for you. However if you are after the newest bestsellers, or a classic opus, then this app can actually work out to be brilliant.So please do pay attention to all the reviews, look through the sort of books you would actually download and then decide. For some it will not work out a good deal for certain, but for many, like me - it is such a bargaini almost feel like i am stealing each month when i pick my new book for a fraction of the normal price.",20 September 2016

I have currently a couple of learn to speak Spanish courses, one of which would have cost in excess of £26.00, and another one which was around £17.00.  I also downloaded a meditation book, which I could never be without as it sends to me sleep in 60 seconds flat!!

There is so much choice and when you compare the cost of a credit to the cost of purchasing the book its a no brainer. Occasionally i have bought extra books outside of my monthly credit, but generally only when the cost of the book has been less than the credit. Couldn't imagine not having this app, its made my commute more bearable and I've listened to some amazing books that I probably wouldn't have read otherwise. Highly recommended!

But the hassle of having to go there, the limitations in catalog titles and terms of lending, make it so inconvenient I would never use it.To me the number of titles and topics available, combined with the ease of purchase and the generous return policy clearly makes it worth while.There may be cheaper options, but if they are so inconvenient or limited that you end up not using them, then it’s not really worth the “savings”.",24 May 2017

558,Callum Davies,Absolute rip-off. Disgraced at this farce.,1.0,1 Book a month for basically £8. Takes me about 3 shifts in work to listen. Therefore spending 27 days waiting for another.Not only that... paying over £70 a year on prime too is disgraceful. There should at least be a discount or more 'tokens'.What a farce.,5 December 2016

566,Amazon Customer,No thanks,1.0,"Cost is unbelievable. Not even slightly tempted to take up the free trial. Surely the whole point of a subscription is to give you more choice, as you are not purchasing individual titles. This seems to me like a contract to purchase 1 title per month.",19 March 2017

568,Yvette Carte-Blanche,No way! Too pricey. Sorry Amazon.,1.0,"Too expensive to even consider. I buy books and ebook and can always get a book cheaper than £7.99. Shame because I like the idea of audio books for both myself to sit back and relax, and for children who find reading challenging. To have someone read along with you when it it hard has been recommended  by learning development  staff at school but this is way too pricey when one would also have to buy the printed version as well to read alongside.",4 April 2017
